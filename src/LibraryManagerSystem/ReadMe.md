LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Project Overview
This is a simple Library Management System developed in Java. It allows users to manage a collection of books via a console-based interface. Users can add books, list all books, search books by title, borrow books, and return books. The system ensures that books cannot be borrowed if already checked out, and handles basic input validation.

Features
Add new books with unique ISBN
List all books with detailed information
Search for books by title (case-insensitive)
Borrow books by ISBN (if available)
Return borrowed books by ISBN
Console menu-driven user interface

Technologies Used
Java SE (Standard Edition)
Java Collections Framework (ArrayList)
Console Input/Output (Scanner and System.out)

How to Run
Make sure you have Java JDK installed (version 8 or higher recommended).
Compile the Java files (Book.java, LibraryManager.java, and Main.java) using your preferred IDE or command line.
Run the Main class to start the console application.
Follow the on-screen menu prompts to interact with the library system.

Usage Example
Add books by entering title, author, ISBN, genre, and publish year.
List all books to see the library collection.
Search books by typing part of a title (case insensitive).
Borrow or return books by entering their ISBN number.
Exit the program by selecting the exit option from the menu.
